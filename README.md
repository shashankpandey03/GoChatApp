# GoChatApp
Very basic go app creating a client server communiction

# Current functionality
1. Server listens on a hard code port
2. Client opens a connection to server, sends message and closes connection

# Things planning to improve
1. Reading port info from prop file or runtime parameter
2. Open a connection only once and then keep sending message to server on the same connection
